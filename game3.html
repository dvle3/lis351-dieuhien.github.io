            <p>New Horizons couldn't have come out at a better time. At the peak of COVID the game allowed players to
                feel
                the fun of exploring the outside world when we were all trapped inside. Playing ACNH after a long day is
                a
                nice pick-me-up. My favorite aspect of the game is getting to talk to my favorite villagers everyday.
                The
                adorable art style and interesting dialouges keep me locked in the game whenever I pick it up. </p>
