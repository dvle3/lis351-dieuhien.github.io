                <p>A very worthwhile purchase! I was able to get so many hours out of this game, and lost track of time so often while playing. I'm not one for scary stories or fighting, but BotW had a good balance of fighting, exploration, and strategy that I was too occupied having fun to worry about when I'd get attacked.</p>
